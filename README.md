# Spiro

This repository contains development work for Spiro, an interpolating spline based on spirals.

It is currently in transition from the original May 2007 version, which contained a very spare GUI editor written in C, to a new Web-based interface.

The Spiro splines are described in great detail in Raph Levien's [thesis](http://levien.com/phd/phd.html).
