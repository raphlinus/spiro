# Spiro

This repository contains development work for Spiro, an interpolating spline based on spirals.

The Spiro splines are described in great detail in Raph Levien's [thesis](http://levien.com/phd/phd.html).

The code in this repository is primarily for reference and historical purposes, as active
development of a new spline continues at [spline.technology](https://spline.technology).
